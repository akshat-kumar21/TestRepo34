Topicals are medications that
are applied directly to a surface

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.830
like the skin or, um, the nasal
passages or even inside the mouth.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.340
So the different types of
topicals for plaque psoriasis

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.590
include a variety of medications.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.779
The most commonly prescribed medications
for plaque psoriasis are topical steroids.

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:29.845
As widely available now,  our tar
and a compound called anthralin,

00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:33.754
the mechanism of action for these
medications is definitely different.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.104
And, and for some of the medications, we
aren't really sure how they work, but we

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.394
know the effect that it has for psoriasis.

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:41.714
So they're usually going
to be anti inflammatory.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.030
Um, vitamin D analogs.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.100
We also use retinoids, um, to
Zeratine to be more specific.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.970
There are other newer medications
that are anti inflammatory.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.050
Roflumilaz, Tepenerof are the two newer
medications that allow once daily dosing.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.570
And then some of the older
medications that we use for

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.840
plaque psoriasis that aren't.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.650
or anti proliferative.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.910
Steroids have a little
bit of both effects.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.240
Um, vitamin D, or calcipatriene
is a vitamin D analog that will

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.340
have a anti proliferative effect.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.910
Um, the newer medications,
roflumilazine, tepenaroff, will

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.740
have an anti inflammatory effect.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.970
And retinoids, like tazerotine, will have
an effect on the proliferation as well.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.940
So really slowing down the rate
at which those skin cells will

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.100
build on top of each other.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.030
For plaque psoriasis, we can
use combinations of steroids

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.230
and vitamin D based creams, as
well as steroids and retinoids.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.529
And then now we have widely available
medications that actually combine the two

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.569
together to get better treatment effect.

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:43.170
So you definitely can combine
treatments and some of the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.090
medications come combined already.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.700
The most commonly prescribed medication
for plaque psoriasis is usually a

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.600
topical steroid, and a potent one.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.960
And the higher the potency of steroids,
the more likely you are to potentially

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.929
have steroid side effects if you're using
them, especially on a long term basis.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.790
We know that plaque psoriasis is
a chronic disease, so we expect

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:07.000
patients to use the medications on
and off for long periods of time.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.790
We may have to worry about thinning of
the skin, um, stretch marks in the areas.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:14.635
Sometimes you can see more
prominent, um, blood vessels

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.085
under the skin in those areas.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:19.845
So that is why we will recommend using
them for short periods of time and

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:21.925
taking breaks from corticosteroids.

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.634
So the benefits of using topical
steroids for plaque psoriasis is

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.335
that you often see the fastest
improvement when you compare to other

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.244
topical medications for psoriasis.

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:34.605
When you look at the benefits of
tizaratine, which is a retinoid, you

00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:39.505
can really see a reduction in the
overproliferation of those skin cells and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.570
As opposed to steroids, when you stop the
Tazerotine, you can sometimes see, um,

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.420
a remission or a remittive effect where
you don't have to use the medication

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.329
for, you know, a few weeks to months.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.149
Um, same thing happens for, um,
Tepenterof, which is a newer once

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.690
a day application medication.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.850
You will be able to actually
stop the medication after two

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.910
months and you may even have a
remittive effect for four months.
